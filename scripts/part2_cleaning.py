'''------------------<Team Discussion>--------------------------
Based on the data understanding and missing data analysis, we have identified that while a significant portion of athletes have sufficient measurements for our selected metrics, there remains a considerable number of athletes with insufficient data. This discrepancy may impact the robustness of our analysis and the validity of our conclusions.
To address this, we propose the following steps:        '''
'''1. Data Imputation: For athletes with missing measurements, we can explore data imputation techniques to estimate missing values based on available data trends. This will help in retaining more athletes in our analysis.        '''
'''2. Focused Analysis: We may consider narrowing our research question to focus on athletes with sufficient data, ensuring that our findings are based on reliable measurements.        '''
'''3. Additional Data Collection: If feasible, we could look into collecting additional data for athletes with insufficient measurements to enhance the dataset's completeness.        '''
'''4. Sensitivity Analysis: Conduct sensitivity analyses to understand how the presence of missing data might affect our results and interpretations.        '''


'''2.2 - Data Transformation Challenge  helper function that returns clean data for selected metrics list and playername list'''

playername_list = ['PLAYER_755', 'PLAYER_690', 'PLAYER_1128']
## Call the function to get data in The data is in "long format" (one row per metric per timestamp) to to "wide format"
