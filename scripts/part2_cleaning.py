## Identify which of your selected metrics have the most NULL or zero records.

get_all_clean_metrics_records()
get_metric_with_most_missing_records()

## For each sport/team, calculate what percentage of athletes have at least 5 measurements for your selected metrics ('leftMaxForce', 'rightMaxForce', 'leftTorque', 'rightTorque', 'accel_load_accum', 'distance_total')
get_athletes_with_at_least_5_measurements_in_selected_metrics()
# 459 out of 1287 players have at least 5 measurements 
# Percentage = (459/1287)*100 = 35.67%

get_athletes_with_5_measurements_not_in_selected_metrics()

## Identify athletes who haven't been tested in the last 6 months (for your selected metrics)
#get_athletes_not_tested_in_last_6_months()
## Determine if you have sufficient data to answer your research question
